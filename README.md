 Project developed in MySQL with datas about air pollution.

 This project done in the one course of Data Sicence Academy, where the goal goes introduce the skills and capabilities of use SQL language.

About dataset

As described in kaggle: OpenAQ is an open-source project to surface live, real-time air quality data from around the world. Their “mission is to enable previously impossible science, impact policy and empower the public to fight air pollution.” The data includes air quality measurements from 5490 locations in 47 countries.

Scientists, researchers, developers, and citizens can use this data to understand the quality of air near them currently. The dataset only includes the most current measurement available for the location (no historical data).

The goal of project are ansewer this asks:

1- Which pollutants were considered in the research?

2- What was the average pollution over time caused by the ground-level pollutant ozone (o3)?

3- What was the average pollution caused by the ground-level pollutant ozone (o3) per country measured in µg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter)?

4- Considering the previous result, which country had a higher overall o3 pollution index, Italy (IT) or Spain (ES)? Why?

5- Which locations and countries had an average pollution in 2020 greater than 100 µg/m³ for the pollutant fine particulate matter (pm25)?
